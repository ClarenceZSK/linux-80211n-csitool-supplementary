12. Can I log other information like payloads or sequence numbers for received packets? [âˆ’]

First, please read #5 â€“ "For which packets is CSI measured?". This answer provides useful background for understanding the relationship and interleaving between CSI measurements and other logs.

You can find the information that may be logged by looking at the iwl-connector.h header file in the driver folder. Each of these flags may be set to relay one or more types of messages from the kernel to userspace programs like log_to_file.

The default setting is IWL_CONN_BFEE_NOTIF_MSK -- the beamforming information feedback is logged. Other options:

Enabling IWL_CONN_RX_PHY_MSK will log additional physical information. However, we already copy the most relevant information from this structure into the beamforming response (see code here).
Enabling IWL_CONN_RX_MPDU_MSK will log packet payloads. This message should include, e.g., the IEEE 802.11 sequence number and of course packet payload which you could use for application or measurement-specific purposes.
... other masks log other information, which it will benefit you the user to discover by reading the kernel. :)
